  ## Project Description:
  - This is a basic note taking application.  When the app is started, you are taken to a page where you are able to add and delete your notes.  Each note can have a title and will persist in memory on the server in a "database-like" json object.

  - This application stores your user input.  The data collected persists in a json object that is saved on a heroku server.  Any data you enter can be deleted per your request.  If the application is being run locally on your machine, the same data object and delete options are available.

  ## Testing Instructions:
  - The application does not have any unit testing, but if you are running the application locally (on your localhost:3002 using port 3002) you can see the stored date in the terminalin a JSON object format.  Although this is not a test, it can serve as confidance that your data is being saved into some type of storage.  The storage is not locally persistant in the browsers cache, but locally in a file on your computer or on the heroku server via the deployed Application.
